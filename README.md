# JLWE10_OF_Team_Editor
A simple tool to edit the saga game option file and swap teams, maybe sooner it will become even more useful

Hi guys! 



Until today this tool can do the following things


-Swap teams:

    Players relink for the two club teams
    Players dorsal/jersey number for the two club teams
    Club teams names
    Club teams 3 letter names
    Club teams data formation (such as captain kicker, strategy, attacking settings, position in the field, etc)
-Export/Import CSV
-Export formation data (as binary file)
-Read PSU ps2 save games  (sooner more format)
-Decrypt/Encrypt Option File

Remember always make backup of your OPTION FILE!!!


In the future i'll add more options (i believe)
